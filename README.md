# Lessons Learned
I spent so much time working on this code, the entire weekend to be exact. I had alot of issues with placements. I was very unorganized in the beginning. I finally sat and mapped it out and it then came together. I spent an entire day trying to do the stretch goals but was stuck on it. All the pilots just printed null, so I had deleted it all and will attempt to rework at this at another time. I need to work more on my time management and study more on the material, as the more work the less time I will have to finish.
